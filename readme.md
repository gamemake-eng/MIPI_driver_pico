# MIPI driver for Raspberry Pi Pico

Driver for spi displays that use the MIPI DCS protocol (st7735, ili9163, etc). It's largely based on tuupola's mipi backend for HAGL (https://github.com/tuupola/hagl_pico_mipi) with the main diffrence being that you are able to use it without any other external libaries.

TODO: Talk about importing the library, how to use it, and configuration options.
